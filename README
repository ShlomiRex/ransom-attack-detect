Workflow Piepline:

1) Select a folder
2) Every x milseconds apply scan of the folder

Assumptions:

1) No ransomware before the scan
2) All files are in ascii format

Greedy algorithem:

1) Check last-modified of all the files
2) All those files that got modified, add to the bin
3) The remaining files, randomly choose (x%) (half) of them, add them to the bin
4) Iterate over the files in the bin
5) If more than y% of the text has change, alert ransomware
